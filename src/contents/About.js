          Hello! Welcome! I'll save you the usual spiel of "always being
          interested in computers" and jump straight into how the world of
          computing captivated me. It all started when I was in elementary
          school and dipped my toes into coding by setting up my own RuneScape
          private servers using Java. I didn't <b>really</b> know what I was
          doing but the thrill of getting something to work after hours of
          tinkering was like no other. After high school, I thought I was more
          interested in Chemistry rather than Computer Science so I got my
          degree in Chemical Engineering but after a few internship rotations at
          chemical plants, oil refineries, etc. I realized that feeling of
          elation was never there like it was with programming. So, I jumped
          headfirst into Capital One's Development Academy which takes you from
          zero to hero in full stack web development - everything from HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript to NodeJS, SQL, and NoSQL. Today, I'm in Capital One's
          Technology Development Program where I've gained exposure to Python,
          AWS cloud resources, Go, and more. I like to think my degree in
          Chemical Engineering is not wasted as I learned how to think
          critically and apply what I've learned to new scenarios for which
          there may be no historical answer.
